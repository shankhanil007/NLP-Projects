There is a place forty kilometres north-east of Portland, Victoria, which makes for an
unusual visit. It is Lake Condah. Here are to be found remains of aboriginal settlements:
the circular stone bases of several hundred huts, rock-lined water channels, and stone
tools chipped from rock not normally found in the area.
